## Logistic Regression

The logistic regression algorithm calculates the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class using a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. It models the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the probability of the target variable being in a particular class. 

#### **Experiments**

##### 1. Load the dataset 

##### 2. Perform dataset inspection

- previweing the dataset, exploring the datase dimensions

- examining the dataset's structure, characteristics and quality

- checking for missing values to ensure its integrity

##### 3. Check the label distribution of the dataset and address class imbalance if present

- Analyze the distribution: Determine the number of samples belonging to each class and calculate the class proportions

- Visualize the distribution: Create visual representations, such as bar plots or pie charts

- Handling class imbalance

    - Resampling: Techniques such as Random Oversampling, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), or Random Undersampling

    - Class weights: Assigning appropriate weights to the classes during model training, gives more importance to the minority class and helps achieve a balanced prediction.

    - Algorithmic approaches: Some algorithms, such as ensemble methods like Random Forest or boosting algorithms like AdaBoost, handle class imbalance inherently and may provide better results without additional modifications.

##### 4. Feature Normalization

Feature normalization, also known as feature scaling, is a common preprocessing step in machine learning that involves transforming the features of a dataset to a standardized scale or range. If the features are not normalized, it can lead to biased model training, as some features may dominate others simply due to their larger values.

methods for feature normalization:
- Min-Max Scaling(MinMaxScaler): Rescales the features to a specified range, often between 0 and 1. It involves subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range (maximum - minimum).

- Standardization(StandardScaler): Standardizes the features to have zero mean and unit variance. It involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

- Robust Scaling(RobustScaler): Similar to standardization, but it uses median and interquartile range to handle outliers instead of mean and standard deviation.

##### 5. Feature Selection using SelectKBest

- Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features from a dataset. The goal of feature selection is to improve model performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency by reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.

- In many datasets, there may be features that do not contribute significantly to the target variable or contain redundant information. Including these features during model training can lead to overfitting, increased computational complexity, and decreased generalization performance. 

- Feature selection methods evaluate the importance or relevance of each feature based on certain criteria. These criteria can be statistical measures, information theory-based metrics, or machine learning algorithms.

    - The SelectKBest feature selection method is one such approach. It ranks features based on statistical evaluation measures, such as chi-squared, ANOVA F-value, or mutual information. By specifying the desired number of top features (k), SelectKBest selects the features with the highest scores, indicating their relevance to the target variable.

##### 6. Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table that visualizes the performance of a classification model by presenting the counts of predicted and actual class labels. The matrix organizes the predictions into four categories: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

The confusion matrix helps in identifying the following aspects:

 - Overall Model Accuracy: It provides a measure of how well the model performs in terms of correctly predicting both positive and negative samples.

 - Class-Specific Accuracy: It allows for an assessment of the model's performance for each individual class, indicating if the model is biased towards a particular class or struggling to predict certain classes accurately.

 - Misclassification Patterns: By examining the distribution of false positives and false negatives, patterns and tendencies in misclassifications can be identified, offering insights into potential model weaknesses and areas for improvement.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are evaluation metrics commonly used in classification tasks to assess the performance of a machine learning model.

- Precision: It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive samples out of all samples predicted as positive. Higher precision indicates a lower rate of false positives and a better ability to accurately identify positive samples.

- Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate): Recall measures the model's ability to identify positive samples correctly out of all actual positive samples. Higher recall indicates a lower rate of false negatives and a better ability to correctly identify positive samples.

- F1-Score: The F1-Score provides a balanced measure that takes into account both precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

##### 7. Further Model tuning

To further enhance the performance of the logistic regression model, you can experiment with various techniques and parameters.

- **Feature Scaling:** Try different types of feature scaling methods and analyze their impact on the classification accuracy of the model. 

- **SelectKBest:** Vary the parameter k, which represents the number of features selected, in the SelectKBest feature selection method. This technique selects the top k features based on their statistical significance.

- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Explore a different feature selection method like Recursive Feature Elimination. RFE recursively eliminates features from the dataset based on their importance. Experiment with different numbers of features to be eliminated at each step and evaluate how it influences the accuracy. RFE can help identify the most relevant features for the classification task. 

- **LogisticRegression() Parameters:** Experiment with different parameters for the LogisticRegression() model itself. You can vary parameters such as the regularization strength (C), penalty type (l1 or l2), solver algorithm, and class weights. By adjusting these parameters, you can observe their impact on the model's performance.

    - you can try using different values of C (smaller or larger) to control the regularization strength and explore different solvers like 'liblinear' or 'lbfgs'.

    - you can experiment with different class weight configurations to address class imbalance if present in the dataset
